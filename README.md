- **Client Mode**: Sends messages to the server and receives responses, supporting both broadcast and private messages.

## ‚ú® Features
- **Role Selection**: Choose between "Your PC" or "Another PC" to configure the appropriate UDP ports.
- **UDP Communication**: Enables real-time messaging between client and server.
- **Real-time Logging**: Display messages exchanged between client and server in the log interface.
- **Dynamic Ports**: Automatically adjusts the ports based on the selected role.
